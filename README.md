wildfly-examples
================

Find some exciting non-mainstream Wildfly examples here!

This repository contains some of the Wildfly PoC's that I find interesting. 

As an example you find the first one created, called "hello-transformer".
That illustrates how you can apply a ClassTransformer to your Java EE modules in Wildfly. Cool huh? :)

Enjoy!
